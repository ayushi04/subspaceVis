This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
library(subspace)
x <- CLIQUE(cars,xi=10,tau=0.06)

```

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(2,5,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,5,6,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,2,7,2,4,6,2,5,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,5,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,3,5,7,3,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,3,4,6,0,0,1), byrow=T, nrow=8, ncol=10)
colnames(A) <- letters[1:10]
rownames(A) <- LETTERS[1:8]
print(A)
```


```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)

longData<-melt(A)
longData<-longData[longData$value!=0,]

ggplot(longData, aes(x = Var2, y = Var1)) + 
  geom_raster(aes(fill=value)) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low="grey90", high="black")) 
+
  labs(x="letters", y="LETTERS", title="Matrix") +
  theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=9, angle=0, vjust=0.3),
                     axis.text.y=element_text(size=9),
                     plot.title=element_text(size=11))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
